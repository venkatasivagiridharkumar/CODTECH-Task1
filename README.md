**Overview of the project**

**Objective**

Develop a Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The program will allow users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers.

**Key Features**

User Interaction:

Prompt the user to input two numerical values.
Provide a menu to select one of the four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: Sum of the two input numbers.
Subtraction: Difference between the first and the second number.
Multiplication: Product of the two numbers.
Division: Quotient when the first number is divided by the second number. Includes error handling for division by zero.
Result Display:

Clearly display the result of the selected operation.
Validation:

Handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric inputs or invalid operation selections.

Implementation Steps:

Use Python's built-in input() function to gather user inputs for numbers and operation choice.
Implement arithmetic operations with simple mathematical operators.
Use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to execute the selected operation.
Handle potential errors, such as division by zero, with exception handling or conditional checks.
Display the result in a user-friendly format.

Expected Outcome:
A user-friendly Python program where users can seamlessly perform basic arithmetic operations by entering two numbers and selecting their desired operation. The program will validate inputs and handle errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project serves as an introduction to Python programming concepts like conditionals, input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.
